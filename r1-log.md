# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [John Jordan]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [August 7, 2020].

## Log

I decided late to begin logging my #100daysofcode updates on Github so I will be starting my R1 posts today, 10/21/20 on day 65.

### R1D65 
I did more networking today, mainly on LinkedIn but it was good to reach out to some new people in fields I'm interested in.  I did put in a little work on my 'Essential Python' learning module but I was a little imbalanced today. #100daysofcode  #freecodecampOK


### R1D66
I had fun building a rock, paper, scissors game with #python today. Was able to incorporate several different items in my code that I haven’t done before. Let’s do it again tomorrow!

### R1D67
Today I learned to not overthink and waste time on what kind of project to build but rather pick something fun but challenging and get to it.  I began a hangman game with grandeos design but dialed it down and made good progress

### R1D68
I worked on my hangman game a little more today.  Got a few things added to it, hit a snag that I'll have to work out tomorrow.  Listened to a good stream by Berenice Dethier on her road to becoming a data scientist. 

### R1D69
I got a good bit of work done on the hangman project today.  Needed a little help getting the blanks to switch to guessed letters but I learned from it. I will add a few finishing touches tomorrow and call it good.

### R1D70
So I knuckled down and completed the #python hangman app (GitHub link in Twitter bio). Learned my logic and code organization needs more work but that’s what I’m doing. Next project will play with an api. Coming soon.

### R1D71
Coded a little app to do searches on the Project Gutenberg list of books using an api from http://gutendex.com.  This one went a lot smoother than the last api call i performed.  That's how it's supposed to go right?

### R1D72
I coded a small program to pick a random name from a list for a giveaway prize my wife requested. Then I finished off a section on #python classes from a tutorial I had started a little while ago. Tomorrow, I’ll learn about Tkinter.

### R1D73
Began learning about tkinter today from a tutorial on http://Lynda.com. Initial thoughts are it looks like a fun and straightforward way to attach a GUI to my #python apps. Looking forward to building with it. 

### R1D74
Had a full day yesterday but did review the #djangogirls tutorial and go through the setup and first parts. Setting up the environment was much easier than last time, understanding django.....still a struggle for me.

### R1D75
Today didn't go as planned. I only worked on my #tkinter learning a little bit because of technical difficulties which was frustrating.  I did get to meet a couple guys who helped me problem solve the issue so that was a silver lining. 

### R1D76
Learned about organizing frames and windows with #tkinter. Anxious to get to the part where I mix my python code with this versatile GUI. 'Patience Iago, Patience'.

### R1D77
### R1D78
So I've been watching a tutorial on using tkinter which i finished today. I'm now trying to go back and make a GUI for one of the #python projects I had made, a random name selector. See how far I get tomorrow.

### R1D79
Started building the GUI with Tkinter for my random name drawing #python program.  Didn't get as far as I'd hoped but took a side track to learning some Git commands and procedures I'll need for......forever. 

### R1D80
I managed to complete the GUI shell with text fields, labels, and a button.  Still working on completing the command logic to finish my first draft of this project. Should finish it up tomorrow.
