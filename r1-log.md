# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [John Jordan]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [August 7, 2020].

## Log

I decided late to begin logging my #100daysofcode updates on Github so I will be starting my R1 posts today, 10/21/20 on day 65.

### R1D65 
I did more networking today, mainly on LinkedIn but it was good to reach out to some new people in fields I'm interested in.  I did put in a little work on my 'Essential Python' learning module but I was a little imbalanced today. #100daysofcode  #freecodecampOK


### R1D66
I had fun building a rock, paper, scissors game with #python today. Was able to incorporate several different items in my code that I haven’t done before. Let’s do it again tomorrow!
